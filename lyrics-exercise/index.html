        <h1>Butter</h1>
        <h4>by BTS</h4>
        <main>
            <p>
                <br> Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
                <br> Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that, ooh
                <br> Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother, uh
                <br> Hot like summer, yeah, I'm making you sweat like that (break it down!)
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> Ooh, when I look in the mirror
                <br> I'll melt your heart into two
                <br> I got that superstar glow, so
                <br> Ooh (do the boogie, like)
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> A side step, right-left, to my beat
                <br> High like the moon, rock with me, baby
                <br> Know that I got that heat
                <br> Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
                <br> Side step, right-left, to my beat
                <br> Get it, let it roll
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
                <br> Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
                <br> Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
                <br> Straight up, I (got ya)
                <br> Making you fall like that (break it down)
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> Ooh, when I look in the mirror
                <br> I'll melt your heart into two
                <br> I got that superstar glow, so
                <br> Ooh (do the boogie, like)
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> Side step, right-left, to my beat
                <br> High like the moon, rock with me, baby
                <br> Know that I got that heat
                <br> Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
                <br> A side step, right-left, to my beat
                <br> Get it, let it roll

                <br> Got the right body and the right mind
                <br> Rolling up the party, got the right vibe
                <br> Smooth like (butter), hate us (love us)
                <br> Fresh boy, pull up and we lay low
