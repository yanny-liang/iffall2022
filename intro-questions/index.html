    <h1>Introductory questions</h1>
    <p>
        1. My name is Yanny Liang. I'm a senior majoring in English literature.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. In addition to my major, I'm also getting a design minor. I'm specifically interested in UI and UX design, 
        so I figured that this class would be a good introductory course for learning about UI/UX design.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. I have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        4. I'm interested in building a personal website and would love to be able to customize it using HTML and CSS.
        Even if I don't learn enough Javascript in this course to be able to build my own website from scratch, I would 
        still like to learn the foundations, so that I can understand what makes a good website and be able to apply those 
        principles in the future to other projects. 
    </p>
    <p>
        5. I think designing for the screen will require considerations about how the user engages with the work that designers for paper or other mediums
        might not have to think about, or think about in the same way. For example, if the goal is to get a user to stay on the webpage for longer or interact
        with it in a specific way such as making a purchase, the design decisions about how to set up the page will be different.

        6. https://www.notion.so > I like Notion's website because it's simple and integrates illustrations with examples of what the software looks like to give
        potential users a glimpse of the experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        7. https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/key-features/ > I think the copy on Apple's website is some of the best in the business. They are fantastic at
        clearly explaining the most important features of the iPhone while selling the product. 
    </p>
    <p>
        8. https://www.theatlantic.com > Reading an article on the website is a smooth experience. It is easy to navigate between different sections and articles.
